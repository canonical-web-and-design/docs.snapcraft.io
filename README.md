# Discourse docs

A basic website application to present the content of a Discourse installation as a documentation website.

Initially, this presents the contents of https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/doc as a website looking similar to https://docs.snapcraft.io/, but this is under active development and will change in the future to be more configurable for other Discourse forums, e.g. https://discourse.maas.io and https://discourse.jujucharms.com.

## Usage

After [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), run:

``` bash
./run
```

And visit http://127.0.0.1:8023 in your browser.
